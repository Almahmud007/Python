It allows you to include an instance of another class as a variable and forward messages to that instance. Essentially, delegation wraps the main class object into a smaller object, enabling restricted access to its resources."

    "**Answer:** Composition involves a class including one or more other classes by storing instances of those classes as instance variables. Unlike inheritance, where all members of a parent class are automatically inherited by a child class, composition allows for selective use of specific methods from a class by utilizing instances of that class. In this approach, the child class does not inherit all members of the parent class; instead, it accesses and utilizes specific methods through class instances."

    "**Answer:** Pseudoprivate attributes serve as valuable tools in larger frameworks or tools for two primary purposes. Firstly, they help prevent the introduction of new method names that could inadvertently override existing definitions elsewhere in the class hierarchy. Secondly, they minimize the risk of internal methods being replaced by names defined at lower levels of the hierarchy. When a method is intended solely for use within a class that may be combined with other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method does not interfere with other names in the hierarchy, particularly in situations involving multiple inheritance.\n",

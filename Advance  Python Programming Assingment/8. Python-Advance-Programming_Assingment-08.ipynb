    " --> In short, the `raise` statement in Python is used to explicitly raise exceptions programmatically. It allows you to generate and raise exceptions, signaling that an error or exceptional condition has occurred. This statement interrupts the normal flow of execution and transfers control to an appropriate exception handler.\n",
    " \n",
    " --> In short, the `try` statement in Python is used for exception handling. It allows you to enclose a block of code that might raise an exception during runtime. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, it can be caught and handled by the corresponding `except` block. This helps prevent the program from crashing and allows for graceful handling of exceptions."

    "In Python, users have the ability to define their own custom exceptions by creating a new class. To do this, the exception class needs to be derived from the built-in `Exception` class, either directly or indirectly. Once the custom exception class is defined, it can be raised using the `raise` statement, which also allows for an optional error message to be provided."

However, in modern versions of Python, all exceptions are implemented as classes that inherit from the `BaseException` superclass.

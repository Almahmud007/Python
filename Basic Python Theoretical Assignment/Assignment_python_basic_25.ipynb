    "**Ans:** Generators and iterators are closely related concepts in Python, with generators being a specific type of iterator. Understanding the relationship between them is important to grasp their functionality and how they can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself, and the `__next__()` method returns the next element in the sequence or raises a `StopIteration` exception when the sequence is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators, on the other hand, are a convenient way to create iterators. They are defined using a special kind of function called a generator function or by using generator expressions. Generator functions are defined like regular functions, but they use the `yield` keyword to yield values one at a time, pausing their execution state and saving it for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between generators and iterators can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generators are a type of iterator: Generators are a specific implementation of the iterator protocol. They provide a concise way to create iterator objects by using the `yield` keyword within generator functions or expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generator functions create iterators: When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator. The generator object can be iterated over using a loop or by using functions like `next()` to retrieve the yielded values one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generators simplify iterator creation: Generators eliminate the need to implement the iterator protocol manually, as they handle the state management and iteration logic behind the scenes. They provide a more concise and readable way to create iterators, especially when dealing with sequences or computations that can be generated lazily or on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, generators are a specific type of iterator that simplifies the creation and usage of iterators in Python. They allow for the creation of iterable sequences using the `yield` keyword within generator functions, making it easier to implement iterators and work with lazy evaluation or large datasets."

    "**Ans** The `yield` statement in Python is used within generator functions to define points at which the function will yield a value to the caller. It serves two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating Values on Demand:\n",
    "   The `yield` statement allows a generator function to produce a sequence of values on-demand rather than generating them all at once. Each time the generator's `next()` function is called, the function execution resumes from the last `yield` statement and continues until the next `yield` or the end of the function is reached. This lazy evaluation of values can be memory-efficient, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preserving Function State:\n",
    "   When a `yield` statement is encountered, the function's execution is paused, and its internal state is saved. This allows the generator function to resume from where it left off when requested. The function's local variables, including loop counters and other temporary values, retain their values between successive `yield` statements, providing a form of persistence across iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these purposes enable generator functions to create iterable objects that produce a sequence of values incrementally, without the need to generate and store the entire sequence in memory. The `yield` statement acts as a temporary \"checkpoint\" that allows the function to produce a value, provide it to the caller, and then continue execution from the same point when requested again.\n"

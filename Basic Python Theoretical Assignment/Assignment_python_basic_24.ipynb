    "**Ans:** `def` statement is used to create a normal function. where as `lamba` expressions are used to create `Anonymous functions`. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between def statements and lambda expressions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax: `def` statements have a specific syntax with a named function, whereas `lambda` expressions are anonymous and have a more concise syntax.\n",
    "2. Function Body: `def` statements allow multiple lines of code in the function body, while `lambda` expressions only support a single expression.\n",
    "3. Naming: `def` statements assign a name to the function, making it reusable and callable by its name, whereas `lambda` expressions create anonymous functions that can be used directly or assigned to a variable.\n",
    "4. Readability and Complexity: `def` statements are more suitable for complex functions that require multiple lines of code and have a meaningful name, while `lambda` expressions are more appropriate for simple, one-time use functions, especially in cases where a function is needed as an argument or in a functional programming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `def` statements are used to define named functions with multiple lines of code, while `lambda` expressions create anonymous functions with a single expression, typically for simpler and one-time use cases."

    "The main benefit of lambda expressions is their conciseness and flexibility. Here are some advantages of using lambda expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Concise Syntax:** Lambda expressions allow you to define functions in a more compact and readable manner compared to `def` statements. They are typically written in a single line, making the code more succinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Anonymous Functions:** Lambda expressions create anonymous functions, which means they don't require a formal name. This is useful when you need to define small, one-time use functions without cluttering your code with unnecessary function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Functional Programming:** Lambda expressions are often used in functional programming paradigms where functions are treated as first-class citizens. They can be passed as arguments to other functions or used in higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. This functional style of programming promotes code reusability and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Improved Readability:** In some cases, using a lambda expression can enhance the readability of the code by keeping the function definition closer to its usage. This is especially true when the function being defined is short and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Encapsulation:** Lambda expressions provide a way to encapsulate behavior within a small function without the need to define a separate function elsewhere in the code. This helps to keep the code modular and self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that lambda expressions are not always the best choice. For complex or larger functions, `def` statements with meaningful names and multiple lines of code may be more appropriate. Lambda expressions are most beneficial in situations where concise, one-time use functions are needed, particularly in functional programming or when passing functions as arguments."

    "The functions `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` are all higher-order functions in Python that operate on iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) and perform transformations or filtering. While they have similarities, they differ in their purpose and behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Map:**\n",
    "- Purpose: `map()` applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator with the results.\n",
    "- Syntax: `map(function, iterable)`\n",

    "- Result: The output is an iterator containing the transformed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filter:**\n",
    "- Purpose: `filter()` creates an iterator that filters elements from an iterable based on a given function that returns a Boolean value (True or False).\n",
    "- Syntax: `filter(function, iterable)`\n",
    "- Operation: It evaluates the provided function on each element of the iterable and retains only the elements for which the function returns True.\n",
    "- Result: The output is an iterator containing the filtered elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduce:**\n",
    "- Purpose: `reduce()` applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing them to a single value.\n",
    "- Syntax: `reduce(function, iterable)`\n",
    "- Operation: It performs a specified binary operation on the first two elements of the iterable, then on the result and the next element, and so on, until a single value is obtained.\n",

    "\n",
    "**- Return Type:** `map()` and `filter()` both return iterators, whereas `reduce()` returns a single value. <br>\n",
    "**- Function Type:** `map()` and `filter()` take a function that operates on individual elements of the iterable, while `reduce()` takes a function that operates on pairs of elements.<br>\n",
    "**- Output Size:** `map()` and `filter()` generally produce an output of the same length as the input iterable, while `reduce()` reduces the iterable to a single value.<br>\n",
    "**- Usage:** `map()` is commonly used for element-wise transformations, `filter()` for element-wise filtering, and `reduce()` for cumulative computations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `map()` transforms elements, `filter()` selectively retains elements, and `reduce()` cumulatively combines elements. Each function serves a distinct purpose and can be utilized based on the specific requirements of the problem at hand."

    "7. Follow naming conventions for variables: use camelCase for local variables (e.g., localVariable) and PascalCase for global variables (e.g., GlobalVariable).\n",
